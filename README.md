# Banana Utils
My collection of CLI utilities written in multiple languages

This repository is newborn and as of now there are not many published utilities.

# How to use
All utilities were written in interpreted languages, and so they require the same interpreters to run. Install Lua, Ruby, Python and Bash to run the respective utilities.

# Folders
This project is divided by folders, each representing a category of tasks the programs do

## File utils
General file/directory manipulation, including copying, moving, compression, etc

## Misc
All utilities that are not included in any category

## Security
Utilities related to security, passwords, encryption, etc

## Shell
All utilities written in Bash go in here
