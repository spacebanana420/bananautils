# Banana Utils
My collection of CLI utilities written in multiple languages

This repository is newborn and as of now there are not many published utilities.

The repository is under construction, all utilities will be separated by folders/categories soon

# How to use
All utilities were written in interpreted languages, and so they require the same interpreters to run. Install Lua, Ruby, Python and Bash to run the respective utilities.
