# Banana Utils
My collection of CLI utilities written in multiple languages

This repository is newborn and as of now there are not many published utilities.

# How to use
All utilities were written in interpreted languages, and so they require the same interpreters to run. Install Lua, Ruby, Python and Bash to run the respective utilities.

# Folders
This project is divided by folders, each representing a category of tasks the programs do

### File utils
General file/directory manipulation, including copying, moving, compression, etc
- **bananarchive.py:** Quick copying of project/code files for organized backup
- **crystalflate.rb:** Deflate file compressor

### Misc
All utilities that are not included in any category
- **subcat.rb:** Prints out the lines of a text file that contain a specific string

### Security
Utilities related to security, passwords, encryption, etc
- **passgen.lua:** Old password generator, use passgen.rb instead
- **passgen.rb:** ASCII and dictionary-based password generator

### Shell
All utilities written in Bash go in here
